    <h1>thoughts on WW2<</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
        Somehow I got into this WW2 story. Now i am thinking about how it all started,
        i mean my curiosity towards it, i guess it all began with oppression/genocide
        in palestine. then i moved into reading about jews then autmatically it led me
        to nazis, third reich and world war 2.

        Read some books not directly related to world war 2 maybe and watched some movies
        then lastly finished watching ww2 in color. when i finished this documentary
        series, i thought it was only 3 hours roughly because i was looking for a condensed
        short version of ww2, wanted to get a general knowledge. Then i realized 3 hours
        basically is just 3 episodes of 13 episodes series and watched all after roughly 2 weeks.
        Basically what I understand that germany started the war, but there were some reasons
        for it coming from ww1 and Hitler used these, bad economics, and publics general
        dissatisfaction to start ww2. All starts by germany invading poland and ends with
        germany losing all the lands they captured (what Hitler is called lebensraum for german people)
        and divided into 4 between uk,us,fr and soviets.
        Especially eastern front took my attention because it is the first time germans started
        losing when they got really close to moscow (18 miles it is said) then from there
        as the documentary said "the tide of the war has changed". Rapid lost started for germany.
        So in a way soviets made huge huge impact on the war. Some america lovers would claim probably.
        And we see it in the general picture. It is generally portrayed in the media that capitalism
        has better economy than communism, USA won the space race, USA won the ww2 etc. But no,
        in all those 3 examples, it can be argued that soviets made the biggest difference. In
        ww2 soviets changed the direction of the blitzkrieg in a way. They lost too many soldiers,
        compared to USA so it can be said that they put more into it.

        I feel like in any of the two following scenarious Hitler would lose. If US was not involved
        in the war soviets would eventually defeat germans. Hitler would have taken UK meanwhile
        but, since soviets has too many quantities compared to germany (soldiers, tanks etc.)
        eventually germans would get fatigue and start losing the war I feel like because Hitler's
        plan was built on being quick (blitzkrieg kinda shows that). And it highly unlikely that
        you can kill millions of soviet soldiers and clean that huge soviet land.
        In another scenario if soviets were absence, I think this would be more possible for Hitler to
        get EU and in the end he would defeat UK and get whole europe continent but after
        pearl harbor when Hitler declared war on US (not the other way yes, Hitler declares war)
        eventually US would make their alliances with whatever left from UK, FR etc. Would fight with
        germany in air and land, this wouldnt be decisive i assume but in the end it is possible that
        another nuclear bomb would be dropped on berlin and germany would be forced to surrender.
        But thinking about once Hitler has the whole europe they would need mand nuclear bombs to
        clean out all those lands or threat them. But what could hitler do though ? How would he
        get across the atlantic and start invading USA? I dont know. I also want to add
        Hitlers tactical mistakes during the war so according to this performance both soviet or
        usa's absence wouldnt give germany a total victory i believe right now. But i feel like
        soviets were more decisive in the war (they were also the first one to get to berlin).

        What I learned from all these long to short. To win conventional wars you need good technology
        (like germans), good tactics (unlike Hitler) and higher number of soldiers compared to your opponents
        (soviets). If you combine those 3, maybe making the last one optional but still you need good amount of
        soldiers, tanks, aircrafts etc. it is highly possible that you can win the war. My stance
        about the war did not change. Yes war is tough, people suffer but i believe it is a necessity.
        Some people in the world needs to die to establish peace for all human beings, you cant
        just agree on them in diplomatic ways or on tables, no. Even in daily life we witness that
        some people are just not agree-able and if they start hurting you, they start hurting innocent
        people then physical actions such as war becomes a necessity.

        Note: by the way i still find it awful, what Hitler did to jews in concentration camps,
        what soviets (it is said) did the when they invaded Germany, rapes and civilian murders etc.
        I still find it awful that Churchill bombed civilian cities in Germany without any military
        significance such as Dresden. I find it awful that USA targeted Hiroshima, 4th biggest populated
        city in Japan and such. There were many many atrocities throughout the war, from many nations.
        Whatever i took some lets say lessons from some nations, also those same nation leaders or 
        whoever did those awful acts, were also war criminals.
