            Since I force myself to write and writing requires thinking. Some say might "you shouldn't write it like this, it should come out naturally" well, i guess it can be argued and not doing it right now. Also think about a lazy person, things come out of naturally out of him/her ? Hardly. Anyways, this is not the topic right now.

            If i dont have any material to write I make my argument or thought around one of the books
            I read recently and I am going to apply this tactic now. I read <i>Neuromancer</i> from William Gibson lastly. I read it because maybe I mentioned it before, I am affected by the cyberpunk culture. Why? because I kinda love tech, computers and I am against current modern systems like democracy or capitalism etc. So I have some parallels between a computer hacker who dreams about better future with some anarchist ideas. So because of that for instance I like the movie matrix and when you read, or watch some stuff about matrix you will came across this book called neuromancer. It is said that William Gibson has huge contribution to cyberpunk genre.

            You can see the evidence of it in his book. There are so many stuff we saw later in ghost in the shell, in matrix or in cyberpunk 2077. For example the cyberspace in the book called literally "matrix". Another one, in the book there is a city called "Nightcity", coincidence with the game cyberpunk 2077 ? I dont think so. Apart from these similarities I am kind of amazed by the description or portrayal of the world which William Gibson draw in his book. There are many detailed explanations of the whats happening around the characters or detailed description of certain objects. I wonder what it takes to imagine such           details and then write about them. There are some "touches" along the story made me asked myself "why this description is here right now ? what is the intention of writing this ?" because sometimes I have found some sentences (well maybe one) did not have any connection with the story in my opinion just added there to make the scene more realistic or to draw reader into the book, just to show a writing skill or beauty or something. You know there are some artworks, and in those artworks maybe there are some pieces that are totally unnecessary but they alone show some beauth or thought. Maybe those sentences have similar uses to that.

            Another thought is that, such futures are possible ? Living in cyberspaces... Well we need to put some details about those futures I guess. Briefly I guess I can say that, it is kind of a world that where we are really advanced in technology, we have cyberspaces, we have general artificial intelligences, we have cyborg people who has synthetic body parts with some additional interesting usages (I dont believe they are better than the natural ones but they do some side quests such as your finger lightup your stove or something similar to that). I belive so, yeah. We are going towards it. I mean we are racing towards it        more likely. We dont really think about the consequences, well majority dont. People are in charge developing those technologies such as artificial intelligence without really solving the problem of aligning human intentions with the artificial intelligence or mass unemployment issues caused by replacing millions of works with robots powered by artificial intelligence etc. So in the future maybe we will have better version of current Meta cyberspace then majority of the people will be unemployed but government will give them an "international monthly payment", this wont be too much we will barely live but           having no worldly aim such as an actual job, will make us desperate. Then we will throw ourselves into  those meta-verses, cyberspaces to docile ourselves. Live our life there. There will be people who will  hack those meta-people, those avatars or get access to certain places like Case in the book. Then maybe all of these will be powered by AI. Then maybe two big companies who run the world will have different AIs, so to make profit and disqualify other those two AIs, more likely AGIs will compete. It will be clash of         two super-synthetic-minds. I mean even these thoughts make a dark, dystopian picture. Maybe this is the effect of general way of picturing such futures in books and movies and I am highly affected by it.

            So, yes, cyberspaces are possible; a high possibility to be more precise. However, I am not sure if I believe in machines becoming better than humans, from overall perspective (including all physical tasks, mental tasks, ethical concerns, empathy etc.). I am not sure those AGIs can be thoughful, concscious like us. I more inclined towards not believing it. So in that future if there is any harm it will come from the humans, AGIs will just be tools. Maybe their interaction will feel real as it is in the books, they will talk like humans maybe but I dont believe they will be superior. Therefore, we have a huge part about the future, to harm ourselves to make a dystopian world or not.
