        I haven't been writing for a long time, not that because I don't have the material but I think its because I have been lazy about it. And also one ask oneself "Why ? Why should I write or keep writing ?" but as I have it mentioned before (maybe) writing has some benefits so I should keep pushing it.

        The concept I want to write about it <i>societal Entropy</i> which is a term I have made up minutes ago (and revised it). It basically comes from the idea of having identical humans in a society. By identical, I mean all the way. Same waking hours, same thoughts, same/similar works, same habits etc. This idea is investigated in the book of Yevgeni Zamyatin, which is called "We". I have found it interesting he was talking about the concept of entropy from a societal perspective. Same people, like a mass production result. The benefits are for the government mostly, for the ones who control them because in this mass production they decide on the design criterias which makes this societal era a <i>dystopia</i>. But, I assume, one may also argue about the opposite side of the spectrum. Like same kind of humans in a society but without totalitarian government, without brainwashing, just all of them converged to a good, ideal human. But this seems like a dream and not reality. Because even if you somehow make everything dressed the same, and have similar foods etc. you can't make everyone to think the same right ?

        Anyways, lets say that everybody also think the same under a totalitarian government. Now this makes the societal entropy of that group maximum right. As its in the physics, maximum entropy means that there is no usable energy and for this society its kind of there is benefit for the humanity coming out of it. It is what I have understood from the concept. So when you have bunch of people have the same thinking in a room, its really hard to find new, innovative ideas. So in this context we need those outliers so they can minimize the entropy and increase the usage therefore (if the concept is applied properly, like properly using energy and not wasting it).Similar things are also said in modern workplaces right ? Think about those who came out with great ideas around you. There is a high probability that they seem weird from modern societal perspective, they don't really blend in, they push back in some circumstances.

        So the idea says that in summary, you should't go for -every human is the same- kind of society because this maximizes the entropy and minimizes the usage. But I would argue against this idea from some perspectives such as I think people should have the same moral values, same right and wrong concepts and as I have probably mentioned it before they must and they came from the creator, Allah (s.w.t.). Also this sameness is only applicable to this world, since the afterlife has different conditions it does not apply to here. The rules of theymodynamics which are put there by the creator are applicable to this world and can be very different for the afterlife if He (Allah, s.w.t.) wants.
