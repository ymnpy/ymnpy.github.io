    <h1>making predictions</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Jim Simons was thinking about this — being able to predict the future in financial markets by looking at the past. Indeed, I have read that John von Neumann once said, “Reality is quite complex, and all we can do is make predictions.”</p>

        <p>In a way, both of them were right. What we actually do (almost always) is make predictions — and this applies to nearly every corner of life. We get out of bed assuming we’ll live through the day and start doing our tasks. We wait at the bus stop predicting that the bus will arrive. We go to our workplace assuming it’s still standing, thinking that otherwise, we’d have heard on the news or someone would have called if there had been, say, a bombing.</p>

        <p>Before heading to work, we stop by the doctor’s office, predicting that the doctor will be there at the appointed time. The doctor, examining your throat and listening to your back, makes a diagnosis based on their training and the data of other people, and by adding their own experience, writes down the medicine they predict will be most helpful.</p>

        <p>Leaving there, you arrive at work ten minutes later than predicted, because you saw an accident on the road — something that didn’t fit your previous data, so your prediction was slightly off. As an engineer, you make certain calculations — themselves based on empirical predictions — and you predict that the product you’re working on will perform its intended function.</p>

        <p>At the end of the day, you repeat your earlier bus prediction and, before returning home, you stop by the market predicting that your favorite milk drink will be on the shelf, as it has been in previous weeks. You make a strong prediction and act on it, heading to the store. Your prediction turns out correct — you buy the milk drink and return home.</p>

        <p>You pour it into the glass that you strongly predict won’t leak, sip it while watching something, and later move on to other tasks. At the end of the night, you brush your teeth — predicting that doing so will protect your dental health, as dentists’ predictions also suggest — and go to sleep predicting that you’ll wake up again tomorrow.</p>

        <p>Throughout the day, you’ve made most of your actions based on predictions. Of course, some of these were what you might call “real” predictions — very strong ones, because through years of collecting data and interacting with others, you’ve significantly increased their likelihood of coming true.</p>

        <p>But generally speaking, what you’ve done is simply look at past data and make forecasts about the future — and even at the start of the day, it wasn’t certain you’d wake up at all. From this perspective, experience seems to be nothing more than collecting enough past data to make good predictions about the future.</p>

        <p>But I must add that this is only a conclusion we can reach within the limits of our minds — and the human mind is limited. Therefore, everything I’ve said doesn’t deny that there is an order in the universe. If there were no order, we’d be frequently wrong even in the simplest physical predictions. For example, when we jump from a height, we predict that we’ll fall to the ground — that’s a sign of order. Random events, by their very nature, cannot be predicted systematically with high probability.</p>

        <p>Ultimately, the existence of order is what makes our predictions applicable. I predict that, in general, the idea I’ve discussed here will make you think a bit too.</p>
