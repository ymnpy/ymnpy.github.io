    <h1>statistical literacy</h1>

        <p>
        In a time where there is abundant of data it is important to understand and get meaning out of them. We may call this era <i>information age</i> and may call the phenomena <i>big data</i>. However we interpret and give meaning to data through statistics (not sure if it is the only way but it is a way) so it is important not to fool ourselves with our own discoveries through data or not to be fooled by others by data. In the following sentences I will lay down some points that I have came across in a book called <i>Art of Statistics: Learning from Data</i> written by David Spiegelhalter.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Care for relativity: </b>This one is not about physical relativity which Einstein was talking about its statistical relativity. More specifically, I am trying to convey here is that sometimes, what is presented in statistical terms is relative significance of the finding and not the absolute. For instance if among 100 people 5 of them gets cancer without eating red meat every day and 6 of them gets cancer while eating meat every day, we can see the difference does not sound very significant. Or we can say non eat meaters have 5% cancer risk while eaters has %6 compared, similar effect. But hear this now: getting cancer by eating meat everyday increases by 20% (from 5 to 6). Now this sounds more alarming but in reality we know that from every 100 person there is only 1 person increase. How we announce such information makes its effect different, doesn't it ?</li><br>

            <li><b>Reframing the result: </b>This trick is also changes how statistical results are labeled, written or represented to make more impactful effect or try to give the reader the intended feeling. You may call it manipulation. It basically refers to saying %5 positive outcome instead of saying 95% negative. Or, for instance, saying our production has negatively grown %14 rather than saying our production has decreased by %14 (I remember there is a similar reframing in the story of 1984 by George Orwell). As you can imagine this will make different impact in some of the audience or reader, since it is possible to activate different feelings with different words.</li><br>

            <li><b>Plot ticks: </b>This one is also a trick to show something more significant than its real value. For instance, imagine you are seeing a graph showing different succesful surgery rates in different hospitals and couple of among them showing significantly longer/higher bars in that bar plot. This may impress you and you may conclude that these hospitals has some serious problems and it is best to avoid them. Well, while it still might be true to best to avoid them (based on their relatively small differences, may be due to some unknown effects) if you read axises, you may and up realising that all succesful surgery rates start from 95%. So seeing 94% among other 95% may seem like a huge difference in that particular plot but if you plot them again by setting the axis start from 0%, such difference will almost be unnoticable and probably won't make the same effect. When the topic is about health this may still give you some ideas but for instance when it is about a company boasting about their product and showing this graph as their superiority then you might think buying such product twice solely based on this graph, because in reality what they are showing is not significant and maybe for example not worth extra money to pay for it.</li><br>
             

            <li><b>Repeatability: </b>To repeat a study and get the same results is also an important factor when assessing the trustability of a work with statistical outcome. Because it is possible that such result may happened only once through some forgery or also some data manipulations or something else. Thus, it would be wise to wait for other research teams to come up with similar results before coming to a certain conclusion about the study. I also want to point out that this is a <i>crisis</i> in science community. Because it is written that most of the scientific studies can't be repetable, they are doing p-hacking and other stuff to show statistical significance out of their work because positive outcomes are more valuable for scientific journals (maybe not all of them) to make a publication. It is written in the book that in psychological studies 97% of works showing statistical significance, but only 36% of their replications showed such significance. Reference for this claim comes from: Open Science Collaboration 2015, <i>Estimating the Reproducibility of Psychological Science</i>. (for a similar reference J.P.A. Ioannidis 2005, <i>Why Most Published Research Findings Are False</i>)</li><br>


            <li><b>Be aware of apophenia: </b>I guess this is the responsibility of who is conducting the study but if people wants to manipulate you or you are conducting such study you should be aware of that just because things are making correlation does not mean that they truly effect each other. Or in other words, famously, <i>correlation does not mean causation</i>. If we are not careful about it, we may end up seeing patterns that does not exist (apophenia). For instance seeing cheese production increase in a country over a year and seeing construction is also increasing does not mean cheese production give rise to construction. This is an obvious observation but when we deal with bunch of data it is possible to miss such important point, so careful about it.</li><br>
        
        </ul>

        <p>That's it. I hope this helps to me and to you.</p>
