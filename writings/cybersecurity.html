    <h1>cybersecurity and importance of digital intelligence</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            Cybersecurity... The topic that I visit from time to time and its one of those times again. I think what draws me towards it can be summed up into two reasons: The first one is, I like computers, I think there is no other machine that I have interest in it other than computers; including airplanes, cars etc. Second, I feel like (and this feeling is a build up result of watching, reading sometimes practicing these cybersecurity stuff), obviously, cyberworld is very important and its importance seems to growing and by important I mean that it gives you a sensation of domination I guess. Yes, from this perspective it can be a dark but, I can't deny its temptation. You can basically get information about and annoy top government people for instance, who you can't even get into proximity of 2 meters maybe in real life. You can get into top secret buildings that are being watched 7/24 with tens of security guards. These possibilities are at the tips of your finger with this craft. Also, you don't have to be absolutely harmful with all these skills (and I don't recommend using knowledge, skills for bad actions), you can be useful and help the oppressed. You can leak information about corrupt governments so you may help to people to wake up against corruption and false systems. You can fight with dark people on dark nets who harm others by selling drugs and such. You can protect your loved ones against attacks from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hat_(computer_security)">black hat hackers</a> through phishing, malware injections etc. once you know these stuff. Another thing is that I think sometimes is that what to do once you know lots of about software development. You can't just write softwares to just write sofwares right ? Having fun is also finite in this world, you can't keep having fun by doing the same thing with same amount and once you become top notch software engineer then what ? I am coming to the conclusion that your sofware knowledge should serve to something, something bigger, a cause right ? I think cybersecurity is a good field for it. Apply this knowledge into writing apps that detects malwares, use your machine learning techniques for detection of phishings etc. Also broaden your knowledge with other things in the cybersecurity field like computer architectures and networking because sofware is not enough, just some percentage of it.
