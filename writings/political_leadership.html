        I have read a book called <i>Leadership</i> from H.Kissinger lately. Didn't know the guy properly but came across couple of comments about him being a war criminal which makes total sense considering USA's foreign policy of bombing other countries and destroying civilian lives. Anyways I am considering this reading as "learning from your enemy" kind of thing. So read the whole thing. Now I try to write something about him so I can keep practicising this muscle of thinking/writing. The author investigates six world leaders in different chapters, I am not gonna delve into that, instead I will try to write about what I understood about the leadership from this book.

        I have got the impression from this book and its emphasized that all of these leaders in took book took their countries in hard times and arguably left them in a better position from a materialistic perspective. How did they achieve that ? Well, some of them were pragmatic. They did not feel shame about being side with powerful countries such as USA. I don't think they were so in love with them, they were just being pragmatic in my opinion, they knew this would give them same worldy benefit and they went for it. Some of them opposed the general views or strageties. I assume this is a hard one. Because even individuals are mostly get caught in the slogans of the society and flow with it. But for a politician this would be even harder because this would also mean that they are going to face with losing public support and if they fail after this decision, they are going to lose their position most likely. So, in those cases the public were thinking one thing and they did the other. Also they were consistent about it, did not give up on their politics right away and waited long enough to see the effects (However, this does not apply in all cases, considering Vietnam War of USA, maybe they should've bailed out earlier and shouldn't have waited that long). Some of them were politically clever, from the perspective of their ideology, they used their cards effectively and gained what they were looking for through politics ("machiavellist" is the right word here maybe). One side note here, one of them taught me that you can also expand your cards just before the deals by being agressive. For instance, if you are looking for a negotation, taking something the enemy would give you an edge on that negotiation. You can say "I will give you this back, if you give this to me etc." But if you did not make that move before, you couldn't put such condition to the table.

        So in summary; analyzing, knowing your country and opponents well, having patience, applying a good strategy even if its against the public view are important things. Even if I made the title "political leadership" these things can be adjusted and applied to any kind of leadership I guess. I will end this piece of text with a quote from Epiktetos, which is also referenced in the book. Translating from turkish to english, it goes like:
        </p>
        <blockquote><i>
        "We can not change the external conditions, but we can always choose our answer to them." 
        </i> -Epiktetos
        </blockquote>
