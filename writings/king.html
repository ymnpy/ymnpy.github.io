    <h1>the king inside of us<</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
        I dont know whether all men feel the same or not but I feel like at least
        most of us, men, feel the same that we want to become someone important, 
        we want to become someone great, an important individual, a hero, a king.

        Maybe we dont realize it throughout the day but if we have some
        alone time we can pull out this thought which stays deep inside of us and
        we can start feeling it, using it.

        I get this feeling whenever I watch/read of such individuals, heroes or
        kings of the past. I hear their speech or see their actions, selfless,
        full of courage, wisdom I kinda get goosebumps. I know I am kinda romantic
        and may get effected from such occasions but if I hadn't some base for such
        actions it wouldnt react. It is like throwing a ball towards a wall and ball
        returns back, one can be sure that wall is real there because if there werent
        any wall, the ball would go straight until it falls due to gravitation. So
        having echoes of those heroic, king-like actions I assume means that we
        men have some sort of base for it.

        But why ? Why men have such feelings right ? Thinking it right now maybe it is
        due to we need to take actions in hard conditions. Because a hero or king becomes
        that person who worth its title in rough situations. In battles, in crysis etc.
        They go forward and do the act, they also courage their people to do the same, 
        they lead them towards chaos for hopefully to a better condition.
        So men need to have this feeling so they can go through these times.
        I am not sure but this is just my opinion.

        Then one may argue that why there are so few of these people. In thousands of
        people there is only one king right ? Well since there cant be many kings of the
        people one of them just taking the responsibility. Maybe becoming a king needs
        a spectrum and one of them has the highest score on that spectrum but almost
        every men in their people is a king himself. Or maybe some of them are so corrupt
        they lost this spectrum or at 0 so discarding those, they are not king but
        still some of them are and one leading king is THE king. And since kings are
        selfless they dont argue with the leading one, accepting that he is more
        worthy than them (well most of the time, sometimes leading one is not worth
        following.) In modern times if we put aside corrupt politicians, every men
        who is struggling to put food on the table for his family is a hero right ?
        They have the courage, they act selfless, they try to make good for their
        people, for their home. They seem to check many attributes belong to a king or a hero.

        On the other hand, when I mentioned about corrupt ones maybe this corruption
        has some reasons behind feeling himself not like a king. Because once you leave
        this feeling, maybe you get the feeling of worthless and worthless man can
        degrage himself further down towards corruption. If a king has courage, this one has
        cowardness; if a king has selfless behaviours, this one has narcissistic behaviours;
        if a king does good for his people, this one only look after for his own gain
        (probably gaining worthless or bad stuff as well). This also reminds me a quote about
        people are becoming saints or pigs (attributed to Viktor Frankl), in this case
        people are becoming kings or (lets say) traitors. While kings are using their inner
        strength and self-value; traitors  commit treason against themselves, against their 
        self-worth.

        Such generalization dont apply to every situation I know it, I believe it is
        impossible to generalize human beings because each of us unique but still we can
        see some patterns and this is one of them I think that all of us men (almost all ?)
        a king inside of us, dont let him down.
