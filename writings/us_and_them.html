        I have met with this gentleman maybe too late maybe right in time, I don't know but I am glad that I have read Cemil Meriç's books, two of them: <i>Bu Ülke</i> and <i>Mağaradakiler</i>. Initially I have thought about writing something about the author Cemil Meriç himself but I don't think I can claim to know him just by reading two of his works and write about him. I also did not want to say something wrong about him because I can see that he was an important intellectual being in Turkish history and I have very much enjoyed reading his works; thought provoking is his writings and more.

        One thought he mentioned throughout in his book with its branches in details, is the concept of east vs west. More specifically, he rightfully criticizes relatively modern times' Turkish Republic -so called- intellectuals, authors, journalists etc.  who try to take in everything the west is offering without any question, like a copy-paste. He called these individuals <i>müstağrip</i>, which means "western wanna-be" or (I have also encountered this meaning) "baffled". For instance he wrote that (and I am trying to translate it to English) <i>"Our intellectuals are a company which imports every disease the west has to offer."</i> This is a truthful observation in my opinion and some other eastern people who would agree with this too. Since the west became a dominant power in the world economically (we may say this has happened after WW2, USA took the world dominancy flag from UK, and imposed its own currency dollar) and the world became more global, cultural characteristics of the west has been spreading. It's on the TVs, on the internet, on the news etc. And somehow those -so called- intellectuals see them as superior and try to import everything from them without checking whether its right or wrong. Don't they understand that the west mostly build upon other peoples resources in both slavery and resources ? USA got its independence in 1776 they were an English colony before whereas Ottoman Empire was founded in 1299. Comparatively, USA does not have a huge cultural background. Not only by its time on the world stage but also geographically it is kind of an isolated continent. On the other hand, Ottoman Empire have spread to continents, thus they have adopted from other people as well this made their culture richer. Who would replace their nice, comfy, clean furniture with second hand wooden chairs ? Wise people wouldn't.

        Also, I did not want to go in to this subject but I'd like to say few things about it: religion side of this comparison. Christianity with its distorted form right now is not comparable to Islam, not at all. For instance in christianity (in its distorted form) we see that in the history (maybe from Roman Empire to Renaissance time period) clercs have used their religion, the distorted form of christianity, as a power tool over the people. I remember reading from one of Daron Acemoglu and one of his colleague's book (I think it was "Power and Progress"), a clerc or someone similar to that role destroyed one of peasants windmill to ensure that the only windmill in that region is his, so he could maintain that economical power. I know some people may call this cherry-picking but we know there are many instances where distorted christianity have been used and maybe is still used as sort of tool to access power over people. Whereas in Islam, for instance, its told that one woman from the public, opposed and corrected the Khalif of that time Omar Ibn al-Khattab (r.a.) over a matter and Omar Ibn al-Khattab (r.a.) has accepted his mistake humbly. In another narrative, when muslims conqured Jerusalem, again Omar Ibn al-Khattab (r.a.) came to the city while pulling his (probably) camel, on which his helper was sitting, because they were taking turns to sit on the camel. His clothing was also modest, so modest that the christian authority surprised to see muslim's Khalif in this modesty. These are only the two opposite instances of those christian clercs piling up wealth. There are many great Islamic figures throughout the history who left this world, without leaving almost nothing behind their back, economically. However, they have left many great examples. People need to understand this: you can't apply inductance (which means coming to a general conclusion from a particular scenario) in any case. It may work sometimes, mostly in science but not in others. Islam have been the dignity of the people and their freedom, freedom from the other creation. I hope I have conveyed my message with this one.</p>

        So my conclusion is with this one is, Cemil Meriç is right about this issue. We need to see things what they truly are, to see behind the western label, to see how rotten some of the products that they are offering while you have much better ones. Even some western people are recognizing their problems (in morality for instance), it is ridiclous to take in everything by imitating the west. Don't get me wrong, I am supporting taking some in like scientific and technical stuff from the west, the ones that will actually help to the humanity. Or we may just take those things and build upon them, improve them. That is an another way, like back in the Islamic Golden Age; take, study, question, get rid of the wrong parts, improve upon it and let the people benefit. But not everything, no... This is also a reminder to myself."
