        I read Hannah Arendt’s famous and widely discussed book, “The Banality of Evil,” from its Turkish translation. I was disturbed that Hannah does not criticize the Zionists, nor does she mention or condemn the atrocities committed by Israel in Palestine. Also, I was bothered by the rumors I understood about Hannah being a former Zionist. However, I thought I could still learn something from her, even if she is an “enemy,” so I finished the book.

        Hannah’s book also received criticism from Jews, perhaps for this very reason, but it’s worth reading. Because in modern times, acts that provoke a misguided society often contain some truth. In the Middle Ages, people who criticized the Church were clearly pointing out some valid points, which the status quo didn’t like. The same can be said for Hannah. The harshest criticism against her came over the “Judenrat,” the Jewish councils. While the Nazis carried out the Holocaust genocide, as I understood from the book, they operated very systematically (something expected from Germans). One of the cogs in this system was the Judenrats, Jewish councils composed of Jews, who determined the names of Jews to be sent to concentration camps and were involved in deportations. So yes, Jews cooperated with the Nazis by sending other Jews to the camps. There were also other Jews who lent money at interest to those trying to escape this oppression because when everything was confiscated from Jews, they had no money to leave the country. Therefore, to get foreign currency, they bought dollars from other Jews at inflated rates (for example, 1 dollar for 3 marks). The Jewish police who collaborated with the Nazis is another topic. So, there were Jews who helped the Nazis knowingly or unknowingly, facilitating the systematic sending of people to death. This is what I understood, and it is the part where Jews also criticized Hannah. I believe there is some truth to this; after all, the “kapos” in the camps are well known. Therefore, a person giving up all dignity to sell out even their own people for worldly benefit doesn’t surprise me much — it’s a base behavior but not new to humanity.

        Regarding the main idea of the book: Hannah emphasizes how ordinary Eichmann was, the man responsible for the logistics of transporting Jews to camps and extermination sites during the Holocaust. He was like a postman, without special hatred towards Jews and unaware of what exactly his party (Nazis) stood for. He appeared to be an ordinary person one might see on the street every day. But what allowed him to play a role in this massive massacre was, in Hannah’s words, his “not thinking.” He never seriously considered what he was doing, the impact of his actions on the world, or whether what he was doing was right or wrong. He became a puppet who simply obeyed orders and closed his ears to everything else. (At the time, voices opposing this were not very strong, so he might not have needed to block his ears—the lack of dissent reflects the miserable state of Europe then.) Eichmann essentially rejected being human, being an individual, and became a cog in the system—unthinking, unquestioning. Being a cog, he abandoned one of the most important human traits: the ability to think. Therefore, he could make no moral decisions, and his moral filter remained inside the “bag of thinking” he had put aside. This allowed him to play a serious role in this shameful massacre in human history. So, according to my own “thinking,” the evil lies in what Eichmann did, while the “banality” refers to how ordinary he was as a person. This is what the book title means — “The Banality of Evil.”

        Today, we see many parallels to this situation. I often feel that most people do not really think about what they do at their jobs. They just try to survive, earn money, and don’t deeply care about what they actually do. Someone working in a place producing alcohol, for example, seems to have put aside deep thoughts about their work, just acting like a machine focused only on the job without reflecting on its consequences. This is not an extreme example. When trying to get help from an institution, you see some people lacking initiative. They say, “That’s our company procedure,” avoiding responsibility and thinking, avoiding being an individual. They just apply the “company procedures” told to them. This is, so to speak, a pitiable situation, and we can already see traces of this behavior in Eichmann years ago. We must not forget that we are individuals, must not put aside the act of thinking, and must always aim to do the right thing. We are not just cogs in the system. We are thinking beings, and we must remind ourselves of that.
