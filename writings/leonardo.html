    <h1>Leonardo da Vinci, my takeaways<</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
        I have finished reading the biography of Leonardo da Vinci from Walter Isaacson, approximately one week ago. It was my second time reading this book but I appeared to me that I did not pay attention to some subjects on my first read so this second time was also beneficial for me hopefully. Motivation to read this book came to my mind randomly I guess, I remember opening the book and reading some sentences early in the morning just to get some motivation from Leonardo's life I guess (since I was reading about human anatomy before and he was also interested in the subject) and ended up reading the whole book again later. Anyways, I want to share some of my takeaways, some of my thoughts about this one of the famous person of the history, one of the interesting minds of the human species.

        Well, since I have finished my last sentence with human species let me start by pointing out that, he was a human afterall. It is stated in the book that he was not good at math, not good with formulas atleast, maybe thats because he did not get that kind of education. Therefore, he made calculation mistakes like finding a quantity 1000 instead of 10000. He even had mistakes in his machinery design. I don't remember if there is more than one to this occurence but, I remember one of them vividly. In his so called tank design, the moving system of the tank consisted of some sort of gear system. Taking its energy from the human using it as arm power and transfer it to the wheels. But if you look the system carefully, this movement end up turning the front and back wheels in opposite direction, which inhibits the movement of this machinery. Maybe this was a lack of attention for a second or maybe it was a bigger mistake of not understanding the concenpt wholly, correctly. So as a human, he made mistakes, that is the point.

        On the other hand, one of the most dominant treat of his character was, withouth a doubt or any debate is <b>curiosity</b>. He was really curious about the world surrounding him. He noted (he took many notes, thats how we have better knowledge about him) for himself to learn about many things. From structures to human anatomy or from fluid mechanics to geology etc. One instance which gives an idea about his curiosity is taking note and reminding himself to <i>describe the woodpecker's tongue</i>. Walter Isaacson, the author, seems particularly impressed by this one. This attribute of his is really important in my opinion, its an attribute which many people seems to lack nowadays. It is an attribute maybe contributed to his fame the most because all of this knowledge fueled with this one. It is an attribute which made him a polymath (having knowledge in wide range of topics). I am not sure about being curious about literally everything because there are things which are not useful and additionally can be harmful. But yes, having curiosity about wide range of topics (if they are beneficial) can be rewarding even it seems at first not directly connected to your profession or your focus. You may end up having a great idea and may realize later the importance of that wide range of knowledge, which is sparked with that curiosity.

        He was a good observer, a very good one. He observed architecture, nature, birds, rocks, human emotions, human anatomy and more. If im not mistaken he even gave some tricks to observe something better by looking at each details one by one and not go to the next detail until being sure you have absorbed the current detail. I think his drawing skills also helped on this one, maybe they worked together. Because to draw something you need to see each detail, not only look, I am talking about really seeing it. I have also draw some objects around me and realized some things that I have probably not realized before. Paid attention to shadows and their formation for instance. Leonardo was probably a master on this one. He observed carefully and delved into the details. Through his observation in human anatomy for instance (he claims he dissected more or around -can't remember- thirty human bodies) he realized that aort valves a.k.a. sinus valsalva, close with fluid vortices (fluid being blood in this case). This phenomenon realized hundreds of years later Leonardo and its not something trivial to observe in my opinion.

        Lastly, I want to talk about the famous technique of his, <b>sfumato</b>. This is not an attribute of his but rather a painting technique but it is interesting that you see this phenomenon in his life also, like an attribute. Walter Isaacson also pointed out to this or something similar to this in the book. As he removed bold contours in his paintings and made transitions between different things smooth in his paintings, he also kind of removed the barriers of reality and imagination in his life, at some times. He just did not stick on one subject like staying in a well defined circle, he did not let his times available technology limit his inventions and make a bold contour of constraint around him, he let his imagination go it seems. He blurred the possibility line between reality and the imagination. Therefore, he invented the technique called <b>sfumato</b> but it seemed to me he had some sfumato in himself. We should also remember that life is not composed of certain things always. Yes if you boil water until a certain temperature under certain conditions it will become a gas, that is almost certain but other than that there are many uncertainty around us everyday. Think about your decisions, in every one of your decisions do you have all the knowledge ? Are boundaries well defined ? I don't think so. Even when you are shopping you don't have all the information about the product you are kind of making your best guess, and using your limited knowledge and limited information given to you. This can be a philosophical topic probably but what I am saying is, there is some sfumato in the life (in my opinion) and Leonardo saw it at object contours and implemented it.
