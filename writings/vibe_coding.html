        <p>
        Why wouldn't I paint my own picture ?<br>
        Why wouldn't I use my own colors ?<br>
        Why wouldn't I use my own voice to tell a story ?<br>
        Why wouldn't I use my own pencil to sketch some things on paper ?<br>
        Why would I use someone elses legs to reach top of the mountain ?<br>
        </p>

        <p>
        Is it better to reach that mountain by walking, seeing around, experiencing the weather,
        the nature, touching the trees along the way, breathing in that fresh air, falling my knee
        by stepping on a stone so I can learn the stones and remind myself be careful or is it better
        to avoid all those experiences, with their joy and suffering and reach to the top with a
        helicopter in 15 mins instead of 3 hours ?
        </p>

        Those are all my critics towards using LLM to code, more specificaly
        "vibe coding", using LLM extensively, just by prompting getting the whole code
        and pasting it to your IDE. Giving the wheel to the LLM and just sitting at the 
        pasenger seat, with map in your hand telling the road but not actually driving.
        (wow, as I do writing I come up with more analogies I guess)
        </p>

        <p>
        If code is only about making a product fast, making profit,
        stepping up ladders on the capitalism or making your boss happy
        then fine, use it extensively. Give the wheel to the LLM. Be the new member of this
        tech system. Strip away yourself from doing something unique (I dont believe in the concept of
        being 100% unique and I think all those -unique- ideas are just synthesis or others
        or ideas in their proximity etc. IMO, from fully materialistic perspective, humans 
        dont come up with stuff they have never experienced before)
        </p>

        <p>
        Sure this approach will give you speed and efficiency. But at what cost ? There are many
        studies claiming that using LLM's decline cognitive functions which makes totally sense to
        me (<a href="https://publichealthpolicyjournal.com/mit-study-finds-artificial-intelligence-use-reprograms-the-brain-leading-to-cognitive-decline/">here is one for instance</a>). Thats important right, but our loss is not only that. We are also giving up the
        joy of coding, the feeling of expressing oneself, the feeling of ownership, enriching
        the society with alternative ways to solve a problem etc. Because with this way I can see
        or feel that everybody writing the same code in a way. Similar GUIs, similar structures...
        Those codes are just adding up to the middle of the gaussian bell.
        </p>

        <p>
        But if coding, programming, expressing your "own" ideas,
        making your own picture, drawing your own figures,
        expressing yourself, performing some kind of so called unique acts.
        Then dont use it excessively. Dont give it the wheel. Dont give it the pen.
        Dont use it to write your whole thing.
        Use it as an assistant okay, but other than that,
        for coding, avoid it. Struggle, learn, have your experience along the way,
        move your brush randomly and enjoy. Thats just my opinion but I believe there
        are many people who would agree with me, especially in the coding community.
        Maybe im under the influence of some high emotions or hormones
        I dont know but thats how i feel right now.
        </p>

        <p>
        It takes out the joy, it takes the feeling that I own something,
        I am putting something into the world. Taking out all of those (I guess I am repeating myself).
        Whoever saying I own this after making LLM write his whole stuff
        and only giving prompts, is just fooling himself. I wonder when they will realize
        they are just making their superiors happy mostly and taking no personal gain. I am not
        saying this from a selfish perspective, you are not taking something from someone else, 
        you are taking something from yourself and throwing it into the air or putting it into
        the LLM database for the next training so instead of doing that, get something, gain something,
        thats not being selfish. Improve yourself intellectually, develop yourself, grow ...
        </p>

        (Adding this later: Some people might argue that this is another abstraction layer,
        like back in the days people were using assembly to write programs then we had C and then Python etc.
        with each layer people became more efficient and didnt have to deal with all those closer to
        machine syntaxes etc. I remember reading about why this is not the same, you can find it probably
        on the net, why this is not an abstraction layer or different but still it does not dismiss my point.
        Beside the fact we already lost some useful information along the way by having those layers -for instance
        whoever knows assembly knows more about computers than me, who has probably better logic about writing
        programs than most people- we can also argue that yes its not the same. You cant just pile up examples like
        that, by using similarity. Because similar things have some thresholds, you need to sustain the balance.
        Let me give you an example. An aluminium beam can hold up X amont of load, you may say well adding 1 kg
        on top of that wont make a difference since X similar to X+1, okay. How about X+2, X+3, X+n ? At some point
        the beam will rupture and imagine that you are using this beam in a building. The building will collapse.
        Although you are just adding loads like adding layers, very similar to the previous state, at some point
        things become catastrophic. Another example I thought about this would be a dam. You are holding X amount of
        water behind its walls. You will just add little bit more water like its previous state, but at somepoint 
        you exceed the threshold and cause a flood etc. You see similarity argument cant go on forever, some things 
        have tipping point, a threshold. So even if LLM is just another abstraction layer, it is a layer above that
        threshold, which gives damage -well not sure about the damage, it sounds harsh, maybe not giving any benefit 
        would be more appropriate, but you get the idea- the to user now.)
